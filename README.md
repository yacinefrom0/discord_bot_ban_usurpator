Anti Usurper Discord

This bot bans users who attempt to impersonate your project

Usage

- If you don't have a dev app yet, create one on https://discord.com/developers/applications/.
- Create a bot for your app. Save its token for later.
- Grant priviliged gateway intents to your newly made bot (just tick the options).
- Invite the bot on your server, with appropriate permissions (namely, read and ban).

Next on your Discord Bot Hosting :

- If you don't have it yet, install python (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Install discord.py via pip (guide here : https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html).
- Then, in bot.py, add your token here : client.run('votre_id')

It should works.
