Anti Usurper Discord

This bot bans users who attempt to impersonate your project
For example, if your project is called "CryptoDay", all users with the username "Cryptoday" will be automatically banned.

Usage

- If you don't have a dev app yet, create one on https://discord.com/developers/applications/.
- Create a bot for your app. Save its token for later.
- Grant priviliged gateway intents to your newly made bot (just tick the options).
- Invite the bot on your server, with appropriate permissions (namely, read and ban).

Next on your Discord Bot Hosting :

- If you don't have it yet, install python (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Install discord.py via pip (guide here : https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html).
- Then, in bot.py, add your token here : client.run('votre_id')

It should works.
